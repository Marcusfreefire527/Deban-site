    <h2>Appel Urgent pour le Déblocage du Numéro WhatsApp</h2>
    <p>
      Dear WhatsApp Support Team,<br><br>
      I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to urgently request the unbanning of my WhatsApp number, which appears to have been mistakenly flagged due to multiple OTP (One-Time Password) verification attempts.<br><br>
      Recently, I discovered that my WhatsApp account has been banned, preventing me from accessing or using the application. I believe this action was triggered by the increased number of OTP requests linked to my account. However, I assure you these requests were made solely by me to resolve issues encountered during a device change and app reinstallation.<br><br>
      During the setup process on my new device, I faced technical difficulties that necessitated multiple OTP verification attempts to regain access to my account. All these attempts were made in good faith and intended to verify my identity legitimately.<br><br>
